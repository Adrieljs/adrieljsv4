                    <p class="content2">Hello! My name is Adriel, also known as 1mmunity#5719 on Discord. In these hard times,
                        i tried to be a Developer, mainly web dev and Discord bot dev. This site is entirely made by me, but the styles
                        are heavily inspired by this site <a href="https://chriscourses.com/">https://chriscourses.com/</a>. More about me and the site below.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content3">This site is static, and currently hosted by GitHub Pages. I bought this domain through DomaiNesia (~$1)
                        in early September, and the SSL Certificate is currently managed by ZeroSSL. I have created 3 other versions of this site as 
                        you can see in the header (Version 4.x.x). <a>Learn More</a>
                    </p>
                    <p class="content3">In my life, i have created more than 10 Discord bots, only 1 has succeeded and is now currently hosted by 
                        Heroku. Its name is Horizon. Horizon was made in July 11th 2020 at 10:01 AM, it first goes by the name of 1mmune+, and is
                        made through Discord Bot Designer and after i thought about it, i went to the discord.js library and code it raw. 
                        Using a maker isn't bad. Though i highly suggest on the one that you can code yourself, not the one that is basically
                        "I want to make a discord bot but i don't want to code." i.e. GhostBot & others. No, i am not saying that you should not use
                        GhostBot, but if you want to make a bot, then learn to do it. If you do, i recommend using discord.js (JavaScript) instead of discord.py (Python),
                        Python isn't bad, Python is really good, but JavaScript is more enjoyable and easier for a beginner (Not in every form). It will boost your
                        Motivation and startup on coding. <a>Learn More</a>

                    <p class="content3">My favorite games are World of Tanks Blitz (WoTB), Among Us and Minecraft (Bedrock). You can add me in WoTB by searching up my
                        username "1mmunity" in the clan -AT-, for Minecraft Bedrock "AdrielMC". If you haven't yet played these games, i recommend you should try it. 
                        You'll enjoy them.

                    Spamming will result in a block. Please note that i
                    won't be opening my inboxes in my email regularly, 
                    so it might take some time to reply. Going to my discord
                    server is the most efficient way, i usually don't read DMs.
